Welcome to pyfcm's documentation!
=================================

PyFCM is a (currently rather small) package designed to facilitate
exploration of fuzzy clustering algorithms in a way that is both readily
usable and easily extended. The API is loosely based on that of
`scikit-learn <http://scikit-learn.org/>`_.
